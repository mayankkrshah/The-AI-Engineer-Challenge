## Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code. 
- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thouroughly to the user.
- Always ask before committing any changes to git
- Always add new dependencies to requirements.txt and pyproject.toml and install dependencies from the file.
- When running the app always ensure existing ports are terminated and the app runs on the same port again.

## Branching Workflow Rule

- You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch tohold those changes. 
- After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
